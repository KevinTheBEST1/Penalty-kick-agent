# Penality Kicks

The aim of this project is to make a robot learn how to
score a goal during a penalty shootout and also make another
robot in the same scenario learn how to stop the goal during
a penalty shootout, so our project is aimed at multi-agent
learning. We have used reinforcement learning to make both
the robot learn by spending more and more time collecting
rewards and analyzing the best move for both the robots.


## Requirements

- Use Vrep from year 2020

- For installation of pyrep follow steps from


```bash
  https://github.com/stepjam/PyRep
```
